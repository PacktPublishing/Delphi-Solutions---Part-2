Delphi is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports rapid application development for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Google Android, and Apple iOS.

This course will build on from Part 1, covering topics such as multithreading, using the parallel programming library, and putting Delphi on a server.
